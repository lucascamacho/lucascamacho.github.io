<h1>Personal blog about PhD routine</h1>
<p>10 Mar 2023</p>
<p> I just finished the Old World Monkey data exploring<br>
</p>

<p>
13 Mar 2023</p>
<p>In this Monday I need to organize how I work in my daily tasks. I have been organized in what do I have to do but not in how many hours I spend in this tasks.<br>
For instance, I have to look for mating system for all the New World Monkeys and when I schedule this task I just write "Platyrrhini - Mating System" without writing<br>
how many hours I will expend looking for primates mating systems. The problem is I end focusing on a single task and others tasks "less important"are not done in time.<br>
Today, I will try to organize this daily tasks and read an article about cranial and mandibular evolution. It looks like the evolution of this 2 "regions"of mammalian cranium<br>
depends on certain and different aspects. The neurocranium evolves following the species filogeny and the mandibular traits evolve due to diet differences representing different selection<br>
pressures. One important aspect which I nedd to study is how PCM (Phylogenetics Comparative Methods) works because probably I will use it to test how mating systems and modularity drives<br> 
primate cranial evolution. Tomorrow starts the first class of multivariate analysis at IME. Fow now, I just gonna read, organize my time and and starts the New World Monkeys data mining.<br>
Wish me luck on searching for the IUCN and ADW.x

I am a little sick rght now, probably a flu or something. I will try to work the best that I can but I can promiss anything. Today I will solve the Git<br>
problem that not allows me to push my commits. Probably is something wrong with the SSH key. The Git is constantly asking me for the username and password<br>
for the pushes, but I need to use the SSH key to make pushes. Git does not allow pushes with username and password anymore. Also, I am using an excell sheet<br>
to control the time that I am working. The sheet is called TARDIS and was developed by my old supervisor Miudo. This sheet is based on the expectancy of how<br>
many hours do you expend on certain tasks and how man hours in fact you take to conclude this tasks. Maybe this help in my daily organization of time.<br>
I will also read Chris Law paper about Sexual Dimorphism in Mustelidae which is one of the papers that interest me in his work. Finally, I will try to<br>
continue my search on ADW and IUCN about the New World Monkeys mating systems and try to start my slides for my first "comitê". Work at home is great but<br>
works when you are sick is just horrible. I fell dizziness and my throat is aching. I hope that is not COVID-19. Tomorrow I will know.

Yesterday I take Joice to an exam which se was sedated. I did not work nothing in my writing diary or the monkeys that I have to look for the mating systems.<br> 
Actually, this is a problem. If I do not have a routine I have some difficults to do my daily tasks. It's like if I consider a day loss, even if I have some time<br> 
to write something, read or looking for some monkey's mating systems. This is oneof the things that I looking for to work on eraly in my PhD routine. Today, my<br> 
day start with a class about statistical mutivariate analisys, the first one of the semester. It looks like it's gonna have a lot of applications in my PhD project<br>
like learning the basics of V/CV matrices, PCA analisys and how I do PCAs when I have different data categories. The professors called it latent variables, which is variables<br>
that we create due to the necessity of reduce dimensionality of the data. Very usefull. I looking into TARDIS right now and it looks like I worked only 4.5 hours in this week.<br>
Of course, we have to consider that I started TARDIS on Tuesday and yesterday I did not work. But damm, 4 and a half hours for Tuesday and today. Let's see how I work today.<br>
Maybe I need a week or more to take some conclusions on this.

Friday. I woke up kind of late today. Its 10:15 AM now and I am just starting my day. Yesterday I have a good day of work searching for monkeys mating systems.<br>
it's a lot of work searching in a lot of different references but it gives a confidence that these data are safe to use. Yesterday I also read the Law article testing<br>
the importance of diet and mating systems driving the sexual dimorphism in carnivoars. He uses a Phylogenetic Comparative Method to estimate ancestral states of<br>
diet and social organization (as a proxy for mating systems) and test different OU evolutive models. The results shows that both diest and mating systems drives the<br>
formation of sexual dimorphism in carnivoars. It's been important reading these papers because the questions are pretty similar to my interests in PhD. Today I will<br>
read Plavcan paper about sexual dimorphism in Primates. Maybe I can find what are the major factors influencing sexual dimorphims and what we know today about Rench's<br>
rule in primates (Rench's Rule says that sexual dimorphism increses as we increase the size of the individuals). I also separate an amout of time just to think about<br>
my PhD project. What are the hypothesis, assumptions and theoretical framework that leads me to my questions. It is necessary to separate big blocks of time just to<br>
think and study. It's just not all about looking for mating systems. Hope I can work with some focus today. Let's see.

I am testing some new HTML skills for the blog. I always use the command br for line break but today I found a way to just tap ENTER and the line breaks just as in a Word
Document. Very well, Monday. My day starts with an writing and GIT trainning for the blog. I started at 10h30AM and I hope to finish it by 11AM. Half an hour a day it's enought 
to get some routine in writing and GIT use. At least for know. Today I will start my power point from the Comitê presentation. I have to think a little about the basics 
ideas of the project and how I can clearly pass these ideas in the meeting. In the weekend I planned to read and study a little but I just don't did nothing for my PhD.
TARDIS says that last week I 9.3 hoours with an average of almost 2 hours a day. This is pretty low and this week I am planning to increase these hours to close to 5 hours a day,
in average. Today I also will read the Plavcan paper about primate mating systems and it's relation to sexual dimorphism. I have also a simple task to make in R about 
multivariate analisys which is basicly generate multivariate data and talk a little about my interests. Maybe this will be a final semester project. Let's see. Finally I will 
looking for the mating system os more 15 Platyrrhini species. I expect to spend the majority of my time today thinking about my project and preparing some slides. I just
remeber that I have to schedule a classroom for my meeting. I will add this to my checklist. I am planning to work 5 hours today, where 30 minutes is for writing, one hour 
for reading Plavcan, 30 minutes for small taks from Multivariate Analisys, 2 hours of thinking time and one hours of monkeys mating systems.

This is a nano recurse to <b>justify</b> a text. Let's see if it works. I will write a little and then I see if add some difference between this paragraph and the above ones. I need to
write a little more on this text so I can see the text justification. Pretty good text formating. I will use it from now on.
