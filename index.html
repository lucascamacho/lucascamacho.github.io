<p> I just finished the Old World Monkey data exploring<br>

<p>In this Monday I need to organize how I work in my daily tasks. I have been organized in what do I have to do but not in how many hours I spend in this tasks.<br>
For instance, I have to look for mating system for all the New World Monkeys and when I schedule this task I just write "Platyrrhini - Mating System" without writing<br>
how many hours I will expend looking for primates mating systems. The problem is I end focusing on a single task and others tasks "less important"are not done in time.<br>
Today, I will try to organize this daily tasks and read an article about cranial and mandibular evolution. It looks like the evolution of this 2 "regions"of mammalian cranium<br>
depends on certain and different aspects. The neurocranium evolves following the species filogeny and the mandibular traits evolve due to diet differences representing different selection<br>
pressures. One important aspect which I nedd to study is how PCM (Phylogenetics Comparative Methods) works because probably I will use it to test how mating systems and modularity drives<br> 
primate cranial evolution. Tomorrow starts the first class of multivariate analysis at IME. Fow now, I just gonna read, organize my time and and starts the New World Monkeys data mining.<br>
Wish me luck on searching for the IUCN and ADW.x

I am a little sick rght now, probably a flu or something. I will try to work the best that I can but I can promiss anything. Today I will solve the Git<br>
problem that not allows me to push my commits. Probably is something wrong with the SSH key. The Git is constantly asking me for the username and password<br>
for the pushes, but I need to use the SSH key to make pushes. Git does not allow pushes with username and password anymore. Also, I am using an excell sheet<br>
to control the time that I am working. The sheet is called TARDIS and was developed by my old supervisor Miudo. This sheet is based on the expectancy of how<br>
many hours do you expend on certain tasks and how man hours in fact you take to conclude this tasks. Maybe this help in my daily organization of time.<br>
I will also read Chris Law paper about Sexual Dimorphism in Mustelidae which is one of the papers that interest me in his work. Finally, I will try to<br>
continue my search on ADW and IUCN about the New World Monkeys mating systems and try to start my slides for my first "comitÃª". Work at home is great but<br>
works when you are sick is just horrible. I fell dizziness and my throat is aching. I hope that is not COVID-19. Tomorrow I will know.
